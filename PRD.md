## Design Direction

The design should feel sophisticated yet approachable - like a premium banking app that's actually enjoyable to use. Think clean, modern minimalism with thoughtful use of color to communicate financial status intuitively. The interface should fade into the background when users are focused on data entry, but emerge with helpful guidance during analysis and planning phases.

## Color Selection

Complementary (opposite colors) - Using a sophisticated blue-green and warm orange pairing that communicates both trust and energy, perfect for financial applications that need to balance security with motivation.

- **Primary Color**: Deep Teal (oklch(0.45 0.15 180)) - Communicates trust, stability, and financial security
- **Secondary Colors**: Soft Gray-Blue (oklch(0.85 0.05 210)) for backgrounds, Light Teal (oklch(0.90 0.08 180)) for subtle highlights
- **Accent Color**: Warm Orange (oklch(0.70 0.15 50)) - Energizing highlight for calls-to-action, budget alerts, and achievement celebrations

  - Background (White oklch(1 0 0)): Dark Gray text (oklch(0.15 0 0)) - Ratio 12.6:1 ✓

## Font Selection

Typography should convey precision and clarity while remaining highly readable across all financial data. Use Inter for its excellent readability in tables and forms, with careful attention to number formatting for financial amounts.

- **Typographic Hierarchy**:
  - H1 (App Title): Inter Bold/32px/tight letter spacing
  - H2 (Section Headers): Inter Semibold/24px/normal letter spacing  
  - H3 (Card Titles): Inter Medium/18px/normal letter spacing
  - Body (Regular Text): Inter Regular/16px/relaxed line height (1.6)
  - Small (Meta Info): Inter Regular/14px/normal line height
  - Numbers (Amounts): Inter Medium/16-20px/tabular numbers for alignment

## Animations

Animations should reinforce the sense of financial progress and provide reassuring feedback during critical actions like saving transactions or reaching budget milestones. Motion should feel precise and purposeful, like the mechanics of a well-engineered financial instrument.

- **Purposeful Meaning**: Smooth transitions communicate reliability, while subtle celebratory animations acknowledge financial achievements and reinforce positive behaviors
